          Hi, I'm John Wick!
          <img src="html_finalprojimages/waving-hand.png" width="60px" />
        </h1>
        <p>
          I'm John Wick, a legendary assassin who once walked away from the
          underworld to lead a peaceful life with my wife, Helen. After her
          passing, I was forced back into the brutal world I left behind when a
          former associate targeted me and destroyed the last gift from Helen,
          my beloved dog. Driven by vengeance and an unbreakable code of honor,
          I became an unstoppable force, taking down anyone who stood in my way.
          My skills are unmatched, my resolve unyielding, and my reputation
          feared by all who know my name. Though I am a man of few words, my
          actions speak volumes in the relentless pursuit of justice and
          retribution.
